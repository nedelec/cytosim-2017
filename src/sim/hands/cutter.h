/// A Hand that can cut a Fiber
/**
 The Cutter is a Hand, and thus can bind and unbind from fibers.
 
 A bound Cutter can cut the fiber at the position where it is attached.
 The rate of cutting is set by @ref CutterPar "cutting_rate".
 
 Depending on the type of fiber, the new ends generated by cutting 
 will have specific dynamic states. Most likely they would be shrinking.
 
 See Examples and the @ref CutterPar.
